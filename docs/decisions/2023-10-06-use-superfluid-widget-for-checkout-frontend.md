# Use Superfluid Widget for Checkout Front-end

## Context

In our Superfluid-Stripe Integration, the need for a user interface becomes apparent as the default checkout UI or its derivatives from Stripe aren't tailored for crypto-based payment methods. To address this, the Superfluid Widget, a free and open-source widget library developed and maintained by our team with community support, presents an ideal solution for a secure and versatile payment interface, designed for real-time blockchain payments with streamlined Supefluid onboarding.

## Decision

Given our strategic position as principal developers of the Superfluid Widget, and acknowledging the needs of our integration project, we'll employ the Superfluid Widget as our checkout front-end. This approach will maximize our utility of the widget's features while keeping the integration process streamlined.

## Consequences

The usage of the Superfluid Widget ensures a reliable and user-friendly checkout interface, enhancing the overall experience for our users. Furthermore, as we contribute to the evolution of the widget alongside the community, we can respond effectively to any updates or improvements, fostering seamless workflow in our development lifecycle.
