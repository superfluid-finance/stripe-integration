# Adopt TypeScript for Development 

## Context

When determining a programming language for development, choosing a language that's known to a wide range of developers is essential. TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, fits this requirement due to its large developer community and extensive support libraries. Additionally, its static types improve code reliability and maintainability.

## Decision

Considering TypeScript's familiarity and reliability, we have chosen to adopt it for our development.

## Consequences

The selection of TypeScript will facilitate codebase accessibility for a broader developer community, ensuring enhanced maintainability and predictability.
