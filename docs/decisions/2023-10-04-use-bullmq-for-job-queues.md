# Use Node.js for Server Runtime

## Context

In order to integrate with Stripe, a stable and widely adopted back-end runtime is required. Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, provides a suitable platform with robust stability and a high adoption rate in the developer community.

## Decision

Given the need for a stable, well-supported backend runtime to assist the Stripe integration, Node.js has been selected.

## Consequences

Using Node.js as our back-end runtime will provide the necessary stability for the integration and ease of adoption for developers with JavaScript knowledge.
