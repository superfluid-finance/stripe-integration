# Create Superfluid-Stripe Integration

## Context

Superfluid is a Web3 ongoing perpetual money streaming protocol which is suitable for recurring subscription payments. Stripe is a tool used for merchant store infrastructure, including payments, products, invoices, customers.

Mercants want to use Stripe with Superfluid because they use it to manage their store.

Stripe has an API and supports marking invoices as paid by outside the system.

## Decision

We will provide a solution for using Superfluid for receiving payments for subscription-based products managed on Stripe.

## Consequences

We will build an open-source and free easily self-hostable scalable back-end and front-end integration for Superfluid and Stripe.
